title: Introducing Atomic layout
description: It's time we pay more attention to spacial distrubution in our layouts. Not only it would make a layout more flexible, but it would dramatically improve its readability and maintainability.

Think of how you create layouts today. Most likely, you're following a system. It's common to have a set of reusable components (atoms) which combine into functional composites (molecules, organisms, pages). This pattern benefits greatly when designing solutions of any scale.

I am talking about [Atomic design](#), a methodology that shaped the way designers and developers envision interfaces. Being a practical user of Atomic design for years now, I notice that its principles often reside in the idiomatic (almost philosophic) realm. However, I would like to explore its applicative nature, and see how developers can take advantage of weilding a layout composition in their work.

## Experiment

...

Wouldn't it be comfortable to declare layouts like this:

```
POST =
  THUMBNAIL TITLE
  THUMBNAIL TEXT
```

A verbose, readable string declaration of layout areas and their spacial relation. But wait, we _do_ have such syntax, and it's **`grid-template-areas` from CSS Grid**!

---

## CSS Grid

_CSS Grid_ is a display model in CSS that allows us to build a grid and place our elements inside of it.

---

## Getting started

### Installation

```bash
npm install atomic-layout
```

> Requires `react` and `styled-components` as peer dependencies.

### Develop

```jsx
<Composition template="header sidebar">
  {({ Header, Sibedar }) => (
    <>
      <Header>Header</Header>
      <Sidebar>Sidebar</Sidebar>
    </>
  )}
</Composition>
```
